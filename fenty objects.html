				Fenty objects is a project that emphasizes on the importance of the synchronization between material objects and human experience in everyday life environment. Objects are the things that constantly surround us, they are primarily designed to be used. Their purpose isnâ€™t based only on their function, but also on their aesthetic value, and every other detail that makes the object user friendly. An object that is designed well can speak for itself, without asking the user to commit much effort. Showing is better than telling.The purpose of this project is to take the viewers attention and put the spotlight on the importance of understanding the basic everyday human-object collaboration.
